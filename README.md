## React Motion

This demo shows an example of using React Motion. The transition motion code was taken from the [repo created by Christopher Lemke](https://github.com/spcbrn/react-motion-sandbox) and then edited for my own styling.

# Spinning Logo (MotionComponent2.js)
Normally, the creat-react-app basic page has the logo animated to spin using keyframes. This demo replaces it with a <Motion> component, and tracks the changing style passed to the motion component in state.

# Transition Between Routes (TransitionComponent.js, TransitionComponent2.js)
This code is primarily borrowed from Christopher Lemke's repo on React motion; it's a great way to add some cool transitions to your page. It uses the <StaggeredMotion> component.

# Spinning/Fading/Size-Changing Text (MotionComponent.js)
This is just to demonstrate some of the other css properties that you can change with React motion - the opacity, the font size, and the rotation are all being changed in this example.
